///Terms of services///

/*
These are the Terms of Service for using the Pokémon TCG API. You must read these terms and agree to them before using an API Key for the Pokémon TCG API account. If you do not agree with these terms, you may not use the Pokémon TCG API.

We're going to use some shorthand to make this easier to read: When we say "Pokémon TCG API" we mean the Pokémon TCG Developer Portal, API, chat bots, chat rooms, and other related services. When we say "we" or "us" we mean the Pokémon TCG Developer team - those that actually develop the API.

We may modify these terms at any time. We’ll try not to, but just know that we can change these terms at any time. If the changes are material, we’ll let you know by email or by posting a notice before the changes go into effect. The notice will designate a reasonable amount of time after which the new terms will go into effect for all users. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you may delete your account and stop using the Pokémon TCG API. If you do not delete your account or do not stop using the Pokémon TCG API within the notice period, your content and use of the site will be subject to the new Terms of Service going forward.
